# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction

This project aims to help a company improve its customer retention by using machine learning to identify high value customers and churn risks. The project involves the following steps:

- **Data exploration and preprocessing:** Analyzing the data set, handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features, and performing feature engineering and scaling.
- **Model selection and evaluation:** Comparing different machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian NB and Kernel SVM and choosing the best one based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Model interpretation and recommendation:** Explaining the model results, identifying the most important features that influence customer churn, and providing suggestions on how to retain customers and increase their loyalty.

The project report contains a detailed description of each step, along with code snippets, visualizations, and results. The report also includes a summary of the main findings and recommendations.

The project is based on a dataset of 7043 customers from a telecom company, which contains information such as demographics, services, contract, billing, and churn status. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

The project is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and shap. The code and the report can be found in this repository.
